Angel:
I am looking for a full-time remote job now and I am willing to work on any time zone.
My ethic is in a word, honest, steady, reliable, dedicated.
I usually work 40 hours per week, but I am always willing to come in early or stay late to help complete a task.

I started software engineering when I was at university.
Since then, I have used my skills to create many small and medium-sized products.
I added the proudest achievement I have ever done to my profile.
